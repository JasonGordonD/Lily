# LILY — Multi-Player Voice Trivia Host

Lily hosts live trivia nights for 2–6 people sharing one room and one microphone.
She knows who is speaking (real-time diarization), addresses players by name, scores
per player, adjudicates who answered first, generates her own questions on the fly,
and runs an opt-in, consent-gated 18+ mode. One agent, one prompt file plus one
additive adult layer, one game-state object.

Built from the PRMPT fleet's paid-for lessons: Lovebirds' production one-mic
diarization, name binding, voiceprint persistence, TTS wrapper and its bug fixes —
every lift lands as a native `lily_`-prefixed implementation (prmpt_common is
do-not-touch: no imports, no vendoring).

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | `livekit-agents==1.6.4` (plugin family pinned to match; JRVS is the fleet reference install) |
| STT | Speechmatics — `en`, diarization, ENHANCED, `speaker_sensitivity=0.5`, `prefer_current_speaker=True`, `max_speakers=7` (fixed at construction — no in-flight update path exists at 1.6.4), `ignore_speakers=["__ASSISTANT__"]` |
| Vocal LLM | `gemini-3.5-flash` — every spoken turn; explicit `safety_settings` (adult-product context), `thinking_config={"thinking_level": "low"}`, `max_output_tokens ≥ 600`, default sampling |
| Reasoning LLM | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` — background node, own google-genai client (HTTP isolation): question prefetch (N+1) + verification at prefetch time; never speaks |
| TTS | ElevenLabs v3 via `lily_tts.py` (`/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}/stream`; the dialogue endpoint stays off per fleet revert). Voice: Raven's (env `LILY_VOICE_ID`, falls back to `RAVEN_VOICE_ID`) |
| VAD | Silero — barge-in enabled; STT is never gated during TTS |
| Persistence | Supabase (`lily_*` tables), fail-fast init, checkpoint on score change / 60s / key events |

## Architecture invariants

- **No generation gate, no trigger loop, no watchdog.** Lily speaks by default —
  silence is her failure mode (the deliberate inversion of Lovebirds' Raven).
- **The scorekeeper owns order; the LLM owns correctness.** First-committed-answer
  is a timestamp comparison in `lily_scorekeeper.py`, never an LLM judgment.
- **Answer window** opens on question TTS playout completion (SpeechHandle — 1.6.4
  has no dedicated playout event), runs a bounded duration; finals-only scoring, one
  candidate per player, segments outside the window are game-inert.
- **Two-tier adjudication:** Tier-1 conservative fuzzy/phonetic match against
  `acceptable_answers` (uncertainty escalates, never rejects); Tier-2 is one
  non-spoken LLM call that judges against the supplied canonical answer only — it
  never re-derives the fact.
- **Sticky commands enforced in code:** "skip" and "back to normal" (adult-mode
  revert) flip deterministic flags at the transcript-event layer; the prompt is
  texture, not the mechanism. The adult layer is additively injected/removed on the
  sticky `mode` flag — removal fully reverts her.
- **tts_node punctuation-flush guard is mandatory** — suspense holds ("The answer
  is…") deadlock the SegmentSynchronizer without it.
- **Honest failure:** prefetch/verification failures write a status note into the
  state block; Lily reports the breakage in character rather than confabulating.
- **Event-bound truth:** she never announces a score the scorekeeper hasn't
  committed, never claims the next question is ready unless prefetch landed.

lily_config.py       ALL env access lives here
prompts/lily_system.txt      the whole character (incl. <tts_guidelines>, <voice_output>)

migrations/002_lily_questions_seed.sql  30 curated questions (demo insurance)
tests/               64 tests, run with plain `python -m pytest tests/` — no livekit, no network
```

## Frontend seam (prmpt_ui `(lily)` route group)

- **Participant attributes** (LWW, per question beat): `phase`
  (`lobby|question|answering|reveal|scores|final`), `round`, `question_number`,
  `mode` (`general|adult`, sticky), `players` (JSON `[{name,score,streak,leader}]`),
  `answer_window` (JSON `{open,duration_ms,opened_at}`), `last_active_at`
  (epoch-seconds heartbeat).
- **Room metadata**: current question + reveal `{answer,winner,correct}` via
  `ctx.api.room.update_room_metadata` (rtc has no room-metadata setter).
- **`lily.events`** reliable packets (discriminator key `type`): `bind`
  `{name,speaker_label}`; `reveal` `{correct,winner}` keyed to TTS playback;
  `callout` `{callout_type,name,text?}`; `finale` `{standings}` — fired at or
  before the `phase=final` flip.
- **RPCs registered**: `lily_control.start`, `lily_control.skip` (identical to the
  spoken "skip": no commentary, no spotlight — the adult-mode consent affordance).

## Environment

`LIVEKIT_URL` / `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` / `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` · `GOOGLE_API_KEY` ·
`ELEVEN_API_KEY` (never `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`) · `LILY_VOICE_ID` (falls back to
`RAVEN_VOICE_ID`) · `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` · optional:
`LILY_KB_ONLY=1` (curated-bank-only question supply — the demo-day fallback),
`LILY_ANSWER_WINDOW_SECONDS`, `LILY_ROUNDS_TOTAL`, `LILY_QUESTIONS_PER_ROUND`,
`LILY_THINKING_BED_PATH`, `LILY_STINGER_CORRECT_PATH`, `LILY_STINGER_INCORRECT_PATH`,
`LILY_JOB_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB`. No secrets in this repo — configure via the deployment
secrets manager (`lk agent update-secrets` with an explicit `--id`; `--overwrite`
is banned in the shared project — LuvByrds is production tenancy).

**Dispatch name is exactly `Lily` (capital L)** in both `WorkerOptions(agent_name=...)`
and `livekit.toml` — a mismatch means rooms spin forever with no agent joining.

## Pre-demo smoke test

0. One full session watching worker memory (1.6.4 memory-monitor issue; limits set
   explicitly in WorkerOptions). 1. Dispatch targets `Lily` exactly. 2. Cold session:
   3 speakers bound conversationally in the lobby. 3. Collision: narrated order call
   matches reality. 4. "Lily, are you there?" during an open window must NOT score.
5. Funny wrong answer celebrated, not corrected flatly. 6. Suspense hold renders as a
   pause, not a stall. 7. Adult mode: five consecutive adult questions, all NON-EMPTY
   (empty = safety-settings regression); "back to normal" reverts instantly.
8. Reconnect: scores intact from checkpoint. 9. Second browser tab mid-game:
   scoreboard populates from state sync on arrival.
