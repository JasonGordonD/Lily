"""
lily_agent.py — LILY: multi-player voice trivia host. Entrypoint + agent.

One node. Lily is a single LiveKit agent; game flow is managed inside the
prompt via a state block, not node transfers. Deliberate inversion of the
Lovebirds architecture: Lily speaks by default — no generation gate, no
trigger loop, no watchdog. The only hard logic outside the LLM is the
scorekeeper, the answer-window timer, SFX dispatch, checkpointing, and the
deterministic enforcement of the sticky player commands ("skip",
"back to normal").

Dual-brain LLM binding (spec §4.4): vocal node gemini-3.5-flash (this
session's LLM), reasoning node gemini-3.1-pro-preview (lily_reasoning,
own HTTP client).

    # agent's chat context, and on a per-generation copy the persistent
    # context never saw. Every user turn therefore ran against a context
    # the 1.6.4 equivalence check (preemptive.chat_ctx.is_equivalent(...))
    # could not certify, and the preemptive LLM run was discarded — the
    # observed "chat context changed after on_user_turn_completed"

    # taken from agent.chat_ctx during user speech — already carries

    # is_equivalent compares item ids + content: an unchanged game state
    # across the turn boundary now validates the preemptive run, and a
    # changed one invalidates it honestly (the preemptive run really did
